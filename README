pyhbench.py is a small script that tries to benchmark the different crypto hash algorithms available for python.

The script will hash files recursively in '/usr/share/doc' or the path is specified as first argument.
It compares the hashing speed of each files with some algorithms from "Crypto.Hash" and the algorithms from "hashlib".

At the end, it will print the total time it took (in seconds) for each hash type.

It uses multiprocessing to speed up things.

During the process, it will print the number of files that are are in the "file queue" and the length of the result queue.
The file queue is the files that are are discovered and need to be hashed.
